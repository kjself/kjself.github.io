				<h2>Pinned Projects</h2>
				<p><u><strong>Adroit Game Jam 2025 Submission</strong></u>: <a class=option href="https://honor-c.itch.io/clap-now-for-helen">Clap Now for Helen</a></p>
				<img src="imgs/clap_now_for_helen.png" alt="screenshot of Clap Now for Helen" style="margin: 5px;" align="right" height=200px width=200px>
				<p class=desc><br>For my second year participating in Adroit's Game Jam through Mizzou, the
					theme for the year was "emotion." After thinking long and hard about how to not make "Inside Out, The Game," we settled on having
					the player act as the prompter/sound guy behind acclaimed talk show "Clap Now for Helen!" 
					<br><br>There were a lot of very fun and impressive submissions to the game jam this year! We did not get to make
					ours as technically engaging as we'd initially hoped, but I still really love the concept and world that we came up with.
